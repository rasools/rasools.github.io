              Since its invention in 2012, CRISPR technology has transformed the face of life science by enabling the generation of thousands of cell lines originating from a wide range of tissues and a myriad of transgenic animals recapitulating disease phenotypes. Huge excitement around the revolutionary aspects of CRISPR-based studies and increasing support from funding agencies have translated into the number of edited cell lines vastly growing every year. The annotation of CRISPR-related articles and extraction of key content has traditionally relied on manual efforts. Manual annotation is error-prone and time-consuming. We explored a novel approach to keyphrase extraction in CRISPR-related articles by harnessing transfer learning and pre-trained Transformer models, specifically Sentence Transformers. Through fine-tuning with a specialized dataset containing articles and key sentences, this study showcases the effectiveness of these models, achieving an impressive Average R-precision of 90.4%. Time savings and workflow efficiency enhancements make this methodology highly valuable in information retrieval. AddCell provides the research community, legislators, regulators, and the general public with a large and in-depth overview of the current status of CRISPR-edited cell lines.

              Title: Systems Biology of Protein Secretion in Human Cells – Multi-omics Analysis and Modeling of the Protein Secretion Process in Human Cells and its Applications.

              My doctoral thesis focused on elucidating the intricate process of protein secretion within human cells and its significance in both medical advancements and disease understanding. I delved into the complexities of how cells produce and release proteins, vital for various functions including hormone signaling and disease development. By employing high-throughput molecular profiling techniques, I examined the inner workings of protein secretion components within cells. Utilizing computational models, I deciphered how alterations in these components impact protein production outcomes. My research identified key genes crucial in optimizing pharmaceutical protein production and highlighted potential biomarkers and drug targets for diagnosing and treating conditions like cancer.

              In my thesis, I constructed a genome-scale metabolic network for Bacillus licheniformis, drawing on similarities with Bacillus subtilis and utilizing data from the KEGG database. This model comprised 1324 metabolites and 1277 reactions. To validate its accuracy, I optimized the M9 minimal medium using the Tagouchi method to create favorable growth conditions and then explored growth patterns across various glucose concentrations. Using continuous fermentation at different dilution rates, I measured glucose uptake fluxes per gram of cell dry weight. Comparing these experimental results to the predictions of the computational model showcased strong agreement between in vitro and in silico experiments across diverse glucose concentrations. Additionally, I applied this reconstructed model to optimize 2,3-butanediol production using OptKnock, identifying two genes whose theoretical deletion could potentially enhance 2,3-butanediol production in Bacillus licheniformis by around 31%.
